# Asterism validator (and simulator)

Given XY coordinates of 3 Natural Guide Stars the program can establish if they are reachable by the LOR boards.

The program also simulates the movement of the LOR boards to reach the NGSs.

The program uses CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) and SFML for graphic rendering.

The program can be normally built with ```cmake``` and ```make```.
